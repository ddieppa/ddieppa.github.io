## What I'm Planning

I'm excited to announce an upcoming multi-part series where we'll build a complete microservices architecture from the ground up. This series will cover:

1. **Part 1**: Service boundaries and domain modeling
2. **Part 2**: Inter-service communication patterns
3. **Part 3**: Event-driven architecture with Azure Service Bus
4. **Part 4**: API Gateway with YARP
5. **Part 5**: Distributed tracing and monitoring
6. **Part 6**: Deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service

## Why This Series?

Based on my experience building distributed systems at companies like Dynata and CrashChampions, I've seen teams struggle with the same challenges:

- How do you define service boundaries?
- When to use sync vs async communication?
- How do you handle distributed transactions?
- What's the right level of observability?

This series will address these questions with practical, real-world examples.
